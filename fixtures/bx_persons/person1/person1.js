I mean, I don't typically hang around in barns, but you're likely to find me immersed in lines of React, React Native, and PHP.</p><p>In my world, curly braces and semicolons are my best buddies. We've been painting the town red (or green) for over 7 years now. From the glossy realms of front-end development to the intricate mysteries of server-side programming, we've done it all together!</p><p>Sure, React and I are thick as thieves. Whether it's a state heist with hooks or charting routes with React Router, we've shared some epic adventures. And PHP? Well, let's just say we go way back. From humble beginnings with vanilla PHP to the grand stages of Laravel and Symfony, we've spun tales that browsers everywhere recount.</p><p>Now, when I'm not busy conversing with my computer or getting caught up in the world of ones and zeros, you'll probably find me enjoying a steaming cup of coffee (Black, no sugar - because, really, life is sweet enough with code!), scribbling down ideas for the next big app, or hunting down the latest tech trends (For fun, I promise. Not like a T-800).</p><p>So, if you're looking for someone who can not only talk to the code but also turn your visions into digital reality, you've come to the right guy. I'm always up for a good challenge, and hey, maybe we could swap some tales of our own!</p>"}
