While developing for each platform individually may seem daunting, a monorepo approach utilizing Next.js and React Native (with Expo) brings a sense of joy and efficiency to the process. Let's explore why developing for multiple platforms simultaneously can be the most fun and rewarding approach.</p><h4>1. Targeting Diverse Platforms</h4><p>With a monorepo approach, developers can target a wide range of platforms, from traditional websites to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), native iOS and Android apps, and even desktop applications. This versatility allows you to reach a larger user base and provide a seamless experience across different devices.</p><h4>2. Reusability and Code Sharing</h4><p>By utilizing a monorepo, you can leverage the power of code sharing between the React and React Native components. With shared business logic and UI components, you can significantly reduce development time and effort, ensuring consistency and maintaining a single source of truth across platforms.</p><h4>3. Streamlined Development Process</h4><p>Developing for multiple platforms simultaneously may take slightly longer compared to building for a single platform. However, the monorepo approach brings efficiency to the development process. With shared tooling, configurations, and infrastructure, you can streamline the build, testing, and deployment pipelines, ultimately saving time in the long run.</p><h4>4. Rapid Prototyping and Iteration</h4><p>The monorepo approach, coupled with Next.js and Expo, allows for rapid prototyping and iteration. Developers can quickly see changes across web and native platforms, enabling faster feedback loops and making it easier to refine the user interface based on user feedback and testing.</p><h4>5. Community and Ecosystem Support</h4><p>Both Next.js and React Native have robust and active communities. The extensive community support ensures a wealth of resources, libraries, and plugins that facilitate the development process. You can benefit from the collective knowledge and experience of developers who have already navigated the challenges of multi-platform development.</p><p>Developing for multiple platforms using a monorepo approach with Next.js and React Native (Expo) opens up a world of possibilities and opportunities. It allows you to create cohesive and consistent user interfaces across various devices, making your networking site accessible and enjoyable for a diverse audience. In our next blog post, we will dive into the advantages of using RESTful APIs to seamlessly connect the PHP backend and ReactJS frontend.</p>", "eval": true }, // eval is needed to force set value to invisible element
